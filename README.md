###PORTABLE APPS SUITE
                        
Whats the meaning about the word Portable? What are Portable Apps? My focus isn't only to get applications for all my portable devices. I also like to have always a clean system. I like the freedom to reinstall my system without to backup each program settings for all applications I have in use. So for me it's definitely more! What do you think?
