Whats the meaning about the word Portable? What are Portable Apps? My focus isn't only to get applications for all my portable devices. I also like to have always a clean system. I like the freedom to reinstall my system without to backup each program settings for all applications I have in use. So for me it's definitely more! What do you think?


The Portable World Project is developed and designed by Si13n7 Developments, founded and managed by a single person, his real name is Roy Schroedel.
